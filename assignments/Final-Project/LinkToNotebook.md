Please use this link for access to our full notebook. It was too large to upload to GitHub directly. I have given access to "Anyone" to the notebook, but please feel free to reach out if there are any issues accesessing the code. Please open the notebook using Google Colab as we have noticed the markdown cells with our documentation do not appear as intended in VSCode, likely due to the font color and the videos are also not displayed in VSCode but they should display correctly in Colab.

Submitted in partnership with Hanwen Yang.
